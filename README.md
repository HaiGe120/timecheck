# What it is

Well, i saw somebody were reposting sth crazy in a public group which i maaged in telegram that rumor is so simple to breaking just using a simple track

# How it work

It's based on BaiduSpider which is a crawler script to rip all content requested off the baidu search engine ( Which is targeted to chineses user, and work best with chinese which has the most worse internet environment )
WHat is do is simply get all the result which you chat with the bot with, it transits what you typed to baiduspider. If the results have the date in only one month and it probably should have shown all years. It will be treated as a rumor.

# Dependencies

< $pip3 install baiduspider telebot >

remember the change your own token in bot.py
